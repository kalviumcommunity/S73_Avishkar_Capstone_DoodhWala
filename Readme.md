# DOODHWALA WEB APPLICATION

## Project: DOODHWALA ðŸ¥›

### Problem Statement:

- Buyers struggle to find fresh, unadulterated milk in their locality.
- Local milkmen lack digital platforms to manage their customers, orders, and payments.

### Solution:

- A web and mobile-friendly app that connects milk buyers and sellers.
- Buyers can search for milkmen nearby, place daily or subscription-based orders, and pay online or via cash.
- Milkmen can list their products, set prices, manage deliveries, and track payments.

### Key Features & Technical Implementation (MERN Stack)

1. User Authentication (JWT + Google OAuth)

- Buyers & milkmen register and log in using email/password or Google.

2. Role-Based Dashboard

- Buyers: Browse local milkmen, check milk availability, place orders, and track subscriptions.
- Milkmen: Manage product listings, order requests, and deliveries.

3. Search & Location-Based Service (Google Maps Linking)

- Buyers find nearby milkmen based on their current location.
- Milkmen set delivery radius to get orders only from nearby buyers.

4. Order Management System (CRUD Operations)

- Place, update, cancel orders with real-time status updates.
- Buyers choose between one-time orders or daily subscriptions.
- Milkmen accept/reject orders and update delivery status.

5. Payment Gateway Integration (Razorpay/Stripe)

- Buyers can prepay or opt for cash on delivery.
- Milkmen track earnings via dashboard.

6. Notifications & Alerts (WebSockets / Firebase)

- Buyers get alerts for order confirmation, milk delivery, and payment reminders.
- Milkmen get order notifications and reminders.

7. Subscription Model (Scheduled Jobs + Database) (Optional)

- Users can set recurring orders (daily/weekly).
- System automatically generates orders for subscriptions.

8. Review & Ratings System

- Buyers can rate and review milkmen.
- Helps in building trust & credibility.

9. File Upload (For Milkmen Profile)

- Milkmen upload business verification documents & profile photo ( farm, milk pictures etc.).
